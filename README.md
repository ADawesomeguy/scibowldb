Science Bowl question API and online browser

SciBowlDB OCRs, analyzes, and categorizes DOE High School Science Bowl questions from several online sources to create a comprehensive, searchable database of __9150__ toss-up and bonus questions, more than any other single source on the Internet, all separated into question text and answer text, and categorized by format, subject, and source. All questions are from either the [official sample question sets](https://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/regional-competitions/resources/hs-sample-questions/), the [California State University Bakersfield (CSUB) Regionals question set](http://www.cs.csubak.edu/ScienceBowl/), or the [1998 or 2005 Nationals question sets](http://students.brown.edu/Brown_University_Science_Bowl/practice.html) as compiled by New England Science Bowl.

This project uses Python and Flask, and the http://www.scibowldb.com website is deployed on Heroku
